# HomeDepotUIAndShoppingCart
the Demo project done by me after learning iOS at RapidValue to understand the full development cycle of iOS app.
the main focus of the app was to implement the iOS concepts learned and get a sense for developing an architecture for an app. the first part of ui flow focuses on the application of new credit card. the task was to crate the UI as per the docs. following are some highlights
1. implemented animations on first launch screen. 
2. added the logic for form validtions in registration screen. 
3. logic to add photos. 

the second part of the app focused on adding items in cart and managing them. and implemening the checking out logic which handled various senarios like adding the items in cart removing them, increasing and reducing quanitites adding cupon code etc. 

coupon codes:
abc,xyz,123
