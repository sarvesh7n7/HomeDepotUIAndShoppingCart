# HomeDepotUIAndShoppingCart
the Demo project done by me after learning iOS at RapidValue to understand the full development cycle of iOS app.
the main focus of the app was to implement the iOS concepts learned and get a sense for developing an architecture for an app. the first part of ui flow focuses on the application of new credit card. the task was to crate the UI as per the docs. following are some highlights
1. implemented animations on first launch screen. 
2. added the logic for indepth form validtions in registration screen.  
3. logic to add photos. 

the second part of the app focused on adding items in cart and managing them.
1. logic for cart item management
2. able to add, delete,remove, increase,reduce quantites in the cart. 
3. using core location to validate the address entered by the user. 
4. weird animation when user adds item to cart.
